# HomeBox (name TBD)

This repo describes HomeBox and stores relevant assets.

HomeBox (name pending) is a service that enables simple "it-just-works" self-hosting for everyone.

There are two components: the service and the product.

The service is the installation of the device, setup of the software, and continuing support of the customer.

The product is the hardware, currently an upgraded Lenovo ThinkCenter m710q, with the preconfigured software.
